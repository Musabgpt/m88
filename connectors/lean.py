"""MusabAI on the phone, focused: the agent gets the tools of Termux, GitHub, Chrome and the phone, and nothing else.

* Termux: bash, runtime_exec and runtime_process_* (node, npm, python, git and gh live there), termux_exec/result.
* GitHub: github, github_monitor and the connected account's github_* operations.
* Code checks: code_check (the language servers VS Code uses: pyright, typescript-language-server, in Termux).
* Chrome and the web: web_search, web_fetch; pages and local servers open in Chrome with the phone's open_url.
* The phone itself: phone, screen_look and phone_routine (saved routines replayed in one call).

Everything else (documents, MCP servers and connected services other than GitHub and Termux, skills, sub-agents and
background agents, memory, self-evolution, observability, routers, RAG, templates...) stays in the code but is not
offered: fewer tools is a shorter request, a faster model and fewer wrong choices. settings "lean": false brings the
full set back.
