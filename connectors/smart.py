"""Smarter and faster turns.

* Leaner requests (faster, cheaper, fewer compactions): tool results from earlier user turns are shortened in what is
  sent to the model (the full text stays in the thread). Only turns before the latest user message change, so the
  request's prefix stays the same while a turn runs and providers can reuse their prompt cache.
* A second look before finishing (Cursor/Claude Code's reviewer): when a turn changed code, the model reviews the
  turn's diff once, with no tools, and either approves it or lists concrete bugs, which the agent then fixes.
